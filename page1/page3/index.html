    <h1>The english translation of the lyrics</h1>
    <p class="paragraph1">Please, Unlock the door for me <br>
O father Inouva (bis) <br>
Make your bracelets shake <br>
O my daughter Ghriva ah <br>
I'm scared, the monster of the woods is here <br>
O father Inouva (bis) <br>
But I'm scared too <br>
O my daughter Ghriva ah <br> <br>

The grandfather, wrapped <br>
In her bathrobe, listening <br>
His son, in his memory of yesterday, eating, turned <br>
The daughter, behind the craft <br>
Alone, weaving the loom <br>
Family together <br>
Listen eagerly to stories she was telling them. <br>
La, la, la, la, la, la, la <br>
Family together <br>
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, <br>
Stories she was telling them. <br> <br>

Please, Unlock the door for me <br>
O father Inouva (bis) <br>
Make your bracelets shake <br>
O my daughter Ghriva ah <br>
I'm scared, the monster of the woods is here <br>
O father Inouva (bis) <br>
But I'm scared too <br>
O my daughter Ghriva ah <br> <br>

The snow behind the door <br>
And the stew heats up in the pot <br>
And those assembled dreaming of the coming spring <br>
.. And the moon and stars are still hiding .. <br>
Refer to the oak and replace the willow mat <br>
Family together <br>
Listen eagerly to stories she was telling them. <br>
La, la, la, la, la, la, la <br>
Family together <br>
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, <br>
Stories she was telling them. <br> <br>

O father Inouva (bis) <br>
Make your bracelets shake <br>
O my daughter Ghriva ah <br>
I'm scared, the monster of the woods is here <br>
O father Inouva (bis) <br>
But I'm scared too <br>
O my daughter Ghriva ah <br>
