    <h1>The story behind this song</h1>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q6gskEicCEs/mqdefault.jpg" alt="image">
    <p id="paragraph1">Much more than a song, the title “A Vava Inouva” by Kabyle singer Idir has almost the status of an anthem. Not only for the Algerians, the Kabyle or the Berbers, but for all the Maghrebis. <br> Avava Inuva tells about a girl in the mountains who suffers daily from the harsh climate of ice and snow as she goes out to bring her young brothers food to eat and wood to make them warm. One day, Ghriba goes out but when she comes back, her father refuses to open the door for her, for fear of the forest monster, until she proves that she is his daughter. Her father asks her to shake her bracelets, so that he can recognize her: “Shake your bracelets, little strange girl. I fear the monster of the forest,” he says in the song. <br> <br>

The song goes on to tell about the daily life and culture of the Kabily people 30 years ago, as they stayed home together with the grandfather, who narrated short stories for them. <br> <br>

It is a historic song that describes how the families in Kabily build their culture, and transmit good behaviors, ideas, traditions to the new generation.</p>
